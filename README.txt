Hi!
This is a custom scenery made by legoboyvdlp to fix the error of floods at TNCM.

It is simple to install.
====================================================

1) Extract the .zip file.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Open the .zip file and copy the TNCM folder inside to 

FGROOT (where you installed FGFS) /data/Scenery

It will look like the picture named step1.png inside the TNCM folder.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Open FGRUN, or your other favorite FlightGear launcher.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Navigate to the page where you can set the paths to all your sceneries and folders; the first in FGRUN by clicking Prev in the bottom right as soon as FGRUN opens (and aircraft picture loads, so you don't make it stop responding)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) Press Add below FG_SCENERY. Navigate to FGROOT/data/Scenery and press TNCM, then click OK. It will look like the picture step5.png
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6) Finally, press the arrows so that the TNCM folder is above TerraSync, and load up TNCM in FlightGear. It should not be flooded. Enjoy!
